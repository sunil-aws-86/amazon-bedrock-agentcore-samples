    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to implement a **multi-agent system with shared memory** using AWS AgentCore Memory and the Strands framework. While our previous examples focused on single-agent memory, this notebook explores how multiple specialized agents can work together while accessing a common memory store.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What you will learn\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to set up a shared memory resource that multiple agents can access\n",
    "- Creating specialized agents as tools with their own memory access\n",
    "- Implementing a coordinator agent that delegates to specialized agents\n",
    "- Maintaining conversation context across multiple agent interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenario context\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll create a **Travel Planning System** with:\n",
    "1. A Flight Booking Assistant specialized in air travel\n",
    "2. A Hotel Booking Assistant focused on accommodations\n",
    "3. A Travel Coordinator that delegates to these specialized agents\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach demonstrates how complex domains can be broken down into specialized agents that share memory the same memory store.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "![architecture](architecture.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "- AWS account with appropriate permissions\n",
    "- AWS IAM role with appropriate permissions for AgentCore Memory\n",
    "- Access to Amazon Bedrock models\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started by setting up our environment and creating our shared memory resource!"
