# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** list the pods in my infra
**Status:** Step 2 of 3 Complete

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Database pod (database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q) is in CrashLoopBackOff state, indicating repeated failures to start successfully
- **Impact**: Potential database service instability affecting dependent applications
- **Severity**: High - Database pod is completely non-functional (0% CPU/memory usage) which likely impacts database-dependent services

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Investigate database pod logs to determine crash cause
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Restore database service functionality and verify data integrity
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Implement monitoring alerts for pod crash states and database health
4. **Follow-up**: Review application dependencies on the database to ensure proper failover mechanisms

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- Web-app-deployment pod is running at 85% memory usage, approaching resource limits that could cause performance issues

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent
- ## Pods in Production Namespace

Based on the results from the `get_pod_status` tool, here are the pods in your production namespace:

| Pod Name | Status | Node | Created At | CPU Usage | Memory Usage |
|----------|--------|------|------------|-----------|-------------|
| web-app-deployment-5c8d7f9b6d-k2n8p | Running | node-1 | 2024-01-15T10:30:00Z | 75% (250m) | 85% (512Mi) |
| database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q | CrashLoopBackOff | node-2 | 2024-01-15T09:15:00Z | 0% (0) | 0% (0) |
| api-service-8d9e2f1b3c-p7q2r | Running | node-3 | 2024-01-15T08:00:00Z | 45% (150m) | 60% (256Mi) |
| product-catalog-service-6f7a8b9c2d-h4k3m | Running | node-1 | 2024-01-14T06:00:00Z | 25% (100m) | 40% (256Mi) |
| product-catalog-service-6f7a8b9c2d-m8n2p | Running | node-2 | 2024-01-14T06:00:00Z | 24% (95m) | 39% (248Mi) |

**Note:** I've checked the production namespace by default. If you'd like to see pods in a different namespace, please let me know and I can check that for you.

**Warning:** According to the `get_pod_status` tool output, there's an issue with the `database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q` pod which is in a CrashLoopBackOff state. This may require investigation.

## 📋 Next Steps

3. Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent: Use get_node_status to understand the nodes where these pods are running
