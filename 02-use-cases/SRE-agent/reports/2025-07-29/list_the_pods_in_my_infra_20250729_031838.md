# 🔍 Investigation Results

**Query:** list the pods in my infra
**Status:** Step 2 of 3 Complete

## 📋 Executive Summary

### 🎯 Key Insights
- **Root Cause**: Database pod (database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q) in CrashLoopBackOff state, indicating repeated failures to start successfully
- **Impact**: Potential database service instability while other services remain operational
- **Severity**: High - Critical database component failing to start properly, likely affecting dependent services

### ⚡ Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (< 1 hour): Check database pod logs to identify specific crash reason
2. **Short-term** (< 24 hours): Resolve database pod startup issues and verify stability
3. **Long-term** (< 1 week): Implement monitoring alerts for pod status and implement database redundancy
4. **Follow-up**: Review web-app-deployment memory usage (85%) to prevent potential memory pressure issues

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
- Database pod continuously crashing may impact data availability for dependent services
- Web-app pod approaching memory limits (85% usage) which could lead to OOM kills

## 🎯 Key Findings

### Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent
- Here are the pods in your production namespace:

| Pod Name | Status | Node | CPU Usage | Memory Usage |
|----------|--------|------|-----------|-------------|
| web-app-deployment-5c8d7f9b6d-k2n8p | Running | node-1 | 250m (75%) | 512Mi (85%) |
| database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q | CrashLoopBackOff | node-2 | 0 (0%) | 0 (0%) |
| api-service-8d9e2f1b3c-p7q2r | Running | node-3 | 150m (45%) | 256Mi (60%) |
| product-catalog-service-6f7a8b9c2d-h4k3m | Running | node-1 | 100m (25%) | 256Mi (40%) |
| product-catalog-service-6f7a8b9c2d-m8n2p | Running | node-2 | 95m (24%) | 248Mi (39%) |

Based on the get_pod_status tool output, I've found 5 pods in the production namespace. Most pods are running normally, but I notice that the database-pod-7b9c4d8f2a-x5m1q is in CrashLoopBackOff state, which indicates an issue that may need attention.

If you'd like to see pods in a different namespace, please let me know which namespace you're interested in.

## 📋 Next Steps

3. Kubernetes Infrastructure Agent will check get_node_status to provide information about the nodes where pods are running
